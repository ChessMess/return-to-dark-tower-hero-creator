# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # start dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # production build → dist/
npm run preview  # preview the production build
```

No test suite exists. No linter is configured.

## Architecture

The app uses **react-router-dom** with a single active route:

- **V2** (`/`) — Hero **Board** creator (1213×808px).

Routing shell: `src/RouterApp.jsx` → `BrowserRouter` with `basename={import.meta.env.BASE_URL}`.

### Directory structure

```
src/
  main.jsx           # mounts RouterApp
  RouterApp.jsx      # BrowserRouter with / route
  index.css          # shared Tailwind entry
  rtdt/              # hero board app
    App.jsx          # state owner + layout + PDF export
    components/
      HeroBoard.jsx
      HeroForm.jsx
    data/
      defaultHero.js
      themes.js      # preset themes, source colors, HSL derivation
    utils/
      heroIO.js
      svgTheme.js    # runtime SVG color replacement + blob URL generation
```

### RTDT details

Uses `hero_board_template.svg` (1213×808px) as the design source. localStorage key: `"rtdt-hero-v2"`.

**Data flow:** `src/rtdt/App.jsx` owns state and passes `hero` + updater callbacks into `HeroForm` and `HeroBoard`. State is persisted via `src/rtdt/utils/heroIO.js`.

**SVG Theming:** Board and virtue SVGs are imported as raw strings (`?raw`), themed via `replaceAll` on hex color values, then served as blob URLs. See `src/rtdt/utils/svgTheme.js`. Theme-dependent colors (7 green-family + 2 sentinels) are replaced; theme-independent colors (`#f0e9dc` gold trim, `#ffffff` white, `#231f20` black, `#9a393e` red) are never touched.

**Recent Heroes:** Uses IndexedDB (`rtdt-hero-recents` database) to store File System Access API file handles for up to 5 recently saved/loaded heroes. Entries include metadata (hero name, author, revision, virtue count) but the actual hero data is read from the file on disk when loaded. Only available in browsers supporting the File System Access API (Chrome/Edge).

**Save-to-Same-File:** On Chrome/Edge, save/load uses `showSaveFilePicker`/`showOpenFilePicker` to get a `FileSystemFileHandle`. The handle is stored in a ref so subsequent saves write directly to the same file. Falls back to legacy download/file-input on other browsers.

**Compatibility:** `src/rtdt/utils/heroIO.js` still supports importing/migrating legacy V1 JSON data when detected.

## TRV Details

**Reference:** See [TRV_REFERENCE.md](TRV_REFERENCE.md) for comprehensive crew leader board implementation guide.

The Thunder Road Vendetta (TRV) crew leader board app runs at the `/trv` route. Uses similar architecture to RTDT but with key differences:

- **Static SVG background** — `src/trv/assets/trv_board_bg.svg` is NOT dynamically themed (unlike RTDT's color replacement)
- **Slots-based data model** — 4-slot array sorted by dice value, not fixed named fields
- **Fixed text positioning** — All text x,y coordinates hardcoded in `src/trv/utils/boardLayout.js`; NO dynamic repositioning
- **Theme colors** — Only `accentColor` (dice/title) and `nameColor` (leader name) are customizable
- **Firebase gallery** — Community submission workflow with admin approval
- **Command tokens** — Simple 0–9 counter (not ability-based like RTDT virtues)

localStorage key: `"trv-crew-leader-v2"`. State owner: `src/trv/App.jsx` via `useLeaderState()` hook.

## Tailwind

Uses Tailwind CSS v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin. There is **no** `tailwind.config.js` or `postcss.config.js`. The single CSS entry point is `src/index.css` which contains only `@import "tailwindcss"`.

## SVG Template Sync — CRITICAL

### `hero_board_template.svg` ↔ `src/rtdt/components/HeroBoard.jsx`

- The SVG template is the authoritative design source — all visual structure, coordinates, gradients, fonts, and layout live there.
- The React component is the implementation of that template, with hero data bound into SVG elements.
- Any visual change **must be made in both files**. Never update one without the other.
- Do not delete the SVG template — it is the source of truth.

## Key Constraints

- Portrait images are stored as base64 data URLs in state (and localStorage). Large images will bloat localStorage.
- GitHub Pages SPA routing uses `public/404.html` redirect + `index.html` decode script.
