# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.4.2] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed

- **Submission Error Details** — Gallery share failures now display the specific reason (e.g. validation message, rate-limit countdown, Firebase error) instead of a generic "try again later" prompt.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed

- **Stale File Handle Overwrite** — On Chrome/Edge, loading a hero via gallery, paste, legacy file input, Reset, or new-tab handoff no longer retains the previously cached file handle. Subsequent saves now correctly open the file picker instead of silently overwriting an unrelated hero file.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **Community Hero Gallery** — Browse heroes shared by the community from within the app. Click **Gallery** in the sidebar to view approved heroes, **View** to load one into the editor, or **Save** to download the JSON file.
- **Share to Gallery** — Click **Share** in the sidebar to submit your hero for community review. Requires Google sign-in. Submissions go through an admin approval process before appearing in the gallery. Duplicate submissions and default/empty heroes are automatically rejected.
- **Admin Moderation Panel** — Hidden admin panel for reviewing, approving, and rejecting hero submissions. Admins can also delete heroes directly from the gallery view. Access is secured via Firebase Authentication with Google sign-in and custom claims.
- **Open in New Tab** — Each Recent Heroes entry now has a small external-link icon below the × button. Clicking it opens the hero in a new browser Tab without affecting the current draft or triggering unsaved-change warnings. The new Tab loads the hero data but is untethered from the original file (first save will prompt a file picker).

### Changed

- **Recent Heroes Row Refactor** — Extracted the Recent Heroes row into a standalone `RecentHeroRow` component with a proper flex layout, replacing the previous absolute-positioning approach.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **Cross-Browser Image Drop** — Dragging an image from another browser window onto the portrait drop zone now works. Previously only local file drops were handled; browser-to-browser drops (which provide a URL instead of a file) are now fetched and loaded automatically.
- **CORS Drop Error Message** — When a cross-origin image cannot be fetched (e.g. hotlink-protected sites), a brief red toast appears: "Could not load image — please save it locally first." The message auto-dismisses after 3.5 seconds.
- **Nested Button HTML Warning** — Fixed invalid HTML where the remove button (×) inside each Recent Heroes entry was nested inside another `<button>`. The outer element is now a `<div role="button">` with keyboard support, eliminating the React hydration warning.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- **Recent Heroes** — A "Recent Heroes" list appears in the sidebar footer showing the last 5 heroes you saved or loaded. Click any entry to reload it directly from the file on disk — including the portrait. Entries show the hero name, author, revision, virtue count, and relative timestamp. Individual entries can be removed with the × button, or clear all at once with the × on the header.
- **Save-to-Same-File** — On Chrome/Edge, the Save Hero button now uses the File System Access API. The first save opens a native OS file picker; subsequent saves write directly to the same file with no prompt. Loading a file also sets it as the active save target.
- **Unsaved Changes Guard** — Loading a recent hero only prompts for confirmation when you have actual unsaved changes. If you just saved, clicking a recent loads immediately with no dialog.

### Fixed

- **Animated GIF Portraits** — Animated GIFs uploaded as portraits now preserve their animation on the board. Previously, the canvas-based image optimization stripped all but the first frame. GIFs now bypass optimization to keep animation intact. If a GIF is too large, the recompress button clearly warns that converting to JPEG will lose animation.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Portrait Quality Slider** — A range slider (10–100%) in the Hero Identity section controls JPEG compression quality for new portrait uploads. Defaults to 80%.
- **Recompress Button** — When a portrait is loaded, a "Recompress at X%" button re-encodes it at the current slider value without needing to re-upload. Useful for reducing localStorage size.
- **Portrait Size Estimate** — Live KB estimate shown next to the quality slider when a portrait is loaded.
- **localStorage Usage Warning** — A warning banner appears below the portrait controls when stored data exceeds 3 MB (yellow) or 4.5 MB (red), prompting the user to reduce portrait quality.
- **Drag-to-Reorder Virtues** — The virtue selector is now a row of draggable chips. Drag any chip to reorder virtues; the live preview updates immediately.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Snapshot to Clipboard** — Camera icon button in the preview toolbar captures the hero board as a PNG image and copies it to the system clipboard. Falls back to automatic PNG download if clipboard access is unavailable. Hold the button for 3 seconds to copy **and** download the PNG simultaneously. Filename uses the sanitized hero name (e.g. `my-hero.png`). Button is disabled when the back face is showing.

### Changed

- **Virtue Dropdown Selection** — Clicking **+ Add Virtue** now automatically selects the newly created virtue in the editor dropdown.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **V2 Hero Board Creator** — All-new board creator based on the full 1213×808px hero board template, replacing the smaller 910×606px hero card as the default view. V1 card creator remains accessible at `/v1`.
- **Dynamic Virtue System** — 0–6 freely assignable virtue slots (up from V1's fixed 5). Each virtue has a type selector: **Standard** (description text), **Advantage** (+1 type advantage), or **Champion** (+2 wild advantages with kingdom selection).
- **Dedicated Virtue Artwork** — Three distinct SVG artwork frames (`virtue_standard.svg`, `virtue_advantage.svg`, `virtue_champion.svg`) rendered per-slot based on virtue type, with empty placeholder shapes for unassigned slots.
- **Standard Default & Advantage Default Virtue Types** — Two new virtue frame styles (`virtue_standard_default.svg`, `virtue_advantage_default.svg`) added to the type selector alongside the existing Standard, Advantage, and Champion options.
- **Champion Virtue Type** — Champion virtues display a centered 2-line title ("CHAMPION OF / THE {KINGDOM}" or "CHAMPION / ABILITY" for all-kingdom), with "+2 Wild Advantages in {terrain}" body text. Kingdom options: ALL, NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST.
- **Banner Action** — New editable text field for the hero's banner action (e.g., "Gain 1 potion"), rendered on the board.
- **Hero Portrait** — Drag-and-drop or click-to-upload portrait image with clip-path framing, matching V1's `xMidYMin slice` approach.
- **Collapsible Form Sections** — Each editor section (Hero Identity, Banner Action, Virtues, Author Info) has a clickable header with a ▼/▲ toggle to collapse or expand its contents; section states persist across page reloads via localStorage.
- **Reset Confirmation Dialog** — Clicking the Reset button now warns you if any fields have been changed from their defaults, preventing accidental data loss.
- **PDF Export with Rasterization** — SVG `<image>` references are rasterized to high-res PNG (3× scale) before PDF generation, fixing corruption issues with complex SVG backgrounds in svg2pdf.js.
- **V1 Data Migration** — Automatically migrates V1 hero data from `rtdt-hero` localStorage key to V2 format on first load.

### Changed

- **Versioned Routing** — App now uses react-router-dom with V2 at `/` (default) and V1 preserved at `/v1`.
- **Separate Storage** — V2 uses `rtdt-hero-v2` localStorage key, independent of V1's `rtdt-hero`.
- **Google Fonts** — Added Karma (600, 700) and Aleo (italic) via CDN for accurate board text rendering.
- **Responsive Board Preview** — V2 hero board now automatically scales to fit the viewport; resizing the browser or toggling the sidebar reflows the card instantly. Toolbar (sidebar toggle, flip, zoom) moved to a dedicated row above the card so controls never overlap the preview. Zooming beyond 100% produces scrollbars for panning.
- **Flavor Text Redesign** — Replaced V2's two separate single-line flavor text inputs with a single textarea (120-character max, up from 2×35). The field includes a live character counter. On the board, text auto-wraps across up to three centered italic lines. Existing saves and V1 migrations are handled transparently.
- **Reset Button Styling** — Reset button now has a visible border, rounded corners, and smaller text so it reads as a proper button instead of plain text.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Card Flip Preview** — The hero preview card now features a flip effect: click the 'Show Back' button to flip the card and reveal a back side displaying author information, description, and a custom background image. The back layout adapts to only show fields that are filled in, and the flip animation is smooth and consistent. PDF export remains front-only.
- **Collapsible Sidebar** — Toggle button (« / ») in the preview panel collapses and expands the editor sidebar with a smooth slide animation; sidebar state persists across page reloads via localStorage

### Changed

- **Author / Revision Badge** — Badge is now hidden by default; only appears when at least one of author name or revision number is entered (default values cleared)
- **Kingdom Dropdown** — Added a blank "— none —" default option; when no kingdom is selected the champion ability tab on the card reads "CHAMPION ABILITY" instead of "CHAMPION OF THE [KINGDOM]"

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-26

### Changed

- **Portrait Import** — Hero JSON paste and file import now only accept JPEG, PNG, and GIF portrait images; other formats are silently ignored
- **Portrait Upload** — Portrait file picker restricted to JPEG, PNG, and GIF; SVG and other formats are rejected
- **Import Validation** — Hero data loaded from storage or imported via file/paste now enforces field length limits consistent with the editor

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **Author Info** — New sidebar section to record author name, revision number, contact info, and design notes/description
- **Author / Revision Badge** — Preview panel shows a subtle badge in the top-left corner when author name or revision is set
- **Contact Badge** — Preview panel shows a contact badge in the bottom-left corner with a one-click copy button when contact info is set

### Changed

- **Move Icon** — Replaced placeholder chevron with authentic boot silhouette matching the official RTDT hero board design
- **Portrait Alignment** — Portrait images now align to the top of the frame instead of centering, so faces and heads are visible first
- **Portrait Drag & Drop** — Portrait upload area now accepts drag-and-drop in addition to click-to-browse; you can also drag a new image onto an existing portrait to replace it
- **Zoom Controls** — Tightened button sizing for a more compact feel

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-25

### Changed

- **Virtue Editor** — Condensed the 5 separate virtue sections into a single unified section with a dropdown selector and ◀ ▶ arrow buttons to cycle between virtues

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **Save / Load Hero** — Save hero data to a JSON file and load it back; filename prompt pre-fills with the hero name
- **Copy / Paste Hero** — Copy hero JSON to clipboard; paste via a modal textarea for easy sharing
- **Portrait Image Optimization** — Uploaded portraits are automatically resized (max 540×740px) and compressed to JPEG at 80% quality, keeping file sizes small without visible quality loss
- **Zoom Controls** — Preview panel now has +/− zoom buttons (25%–300%) with a click-to-reset percentage indicator
- **Status Feedback** — Transient success/error messages for save, load, copy, and paste operations
